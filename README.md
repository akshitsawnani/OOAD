# OOAD-project

# IIT JODHPUR Online Delivery System  

A CLI based online order,delivery and tracking system, completed under Dr. Anand Mishra.

# Learnings 
  - Used Object Oriented Programming concepts and kept the code modular by implementing different headers for each type of user , namely Admin,Customer and Delivery Person.
  - Set up SMTP to send order confirmation and OTPs via email.
  - Used SQLite 3's C++ API to handle actions linke order tracking and transaction records.
  - Worked in a team of 3 people and understood importance of version control systems.
  - Implemented various functionalities in CLI interface like live refreshing after every input , password hiding when the user is entering passwords in CLI.
  - Implemented basic password security standards by only storing hashes of user password.
  - Implemented a mechanism which will log major activities of program runtime in a text file. This later helped in debugging.
  - Tried to host the database on web but faced difficulties due to C++ limitations.
